const materials = ["Hydrogen","Oxygen","Iron","Lithium"];
//Old Function Syntax
materials.map(function(material) {
  return material.length;
})

//Arrow Function Syntax
//materials.map(material => return material.length); /* return needs {}*/
materials.map(x => x.length);

//MAP METHOD IMPORTANT POINT
//1. Inside () of map needs to have a function inside of it.
//2. map runs as man times as there are objects inside of the array
const matter = ['black holes', 'sun', 'planets'];
matter.map(hey => console.log(hey));
